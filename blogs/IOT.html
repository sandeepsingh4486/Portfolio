        <h1>Basics of IoT (Internet of Things) for All</h1>
    </header>
    <article>
        <h2>What is IoT?</h2>
        <p>
            The **Internet of Things (IoT)** refers to the network of physical devices, vehicles, appliances, and other objects embedded with sensors, software, and other technologies to connect and exchange data over the internet. These devices communicate with each other and with centralized systems to enable smarter automation and decision-making processes.
        </p>
        <p>
            IoT has revolutionized multiple sectors, including healthcare, agriculture, transportation, and smart homes, by enabling real-time data collection, analysis, and response.
        </p>

        <h2>Key Components of IoT</h2>
        <p>
            The fundamental components of an IoT system include:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Devices/Things:</strong> Physical objects like sensors, actuators, wearables, and machines that collect or generate data.</li>
            <li><strong>Connectivity:</strong> The means by which devices are connected to the network, such as Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, Zigbee, and cellular networks.</li>
            <li><strong>Data Processing:</strong> The process of analyzing data, often in the cloud, to extract meaningful insights or take actions based on pre-defined logic.</li>
            <li><strong>User Interface:</strong> The platform or interface through which users can interact with the system, such as mobile apps, dashboards, or web interfaces.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>IoT Protocols and Standards</h2>
        <p>
            Communication between IoT devices is based on various **protocols** that enable secure, reliable, and efficient transmission of data. These protocols vary based on the type of network, distance, and data requirements. Some common IoT protocols and standards are:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>MQTT (Message Queuing Telemetry Transport):</strong> A lightweight messaging protocol used for low-bandwidth and high-latency networks, ideal for sending small amounts of data.</li>
            <li><strong>HTTP/HTTPS:</strong> Hypertext Transfer Protocol (Secure) is commonly used for communication between IoT devices and cloud servers, especially in applications requiring high security.</li>
            <li><strong>CoAP (Constrained Application Protocol):</strong> A protocol designed for IoT applications that require low overhead, primarily in constrained environments such as sensor networks.</li>
            <li><strong>Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE):</strong> Used for short-range communication in IoT devices like wearables, healthcare devices, and smart home applications.</li>
            <li><strong>Zigbee:</strong> A low-power, short-range communication standard often used in home automation, such as smart lights and appliances.</li>
            <li><strong>LoRaWAN:</strong> A long-range, low-power protocol ideal for large-scale IoT networks where devices are spread over long distances, such as smart cities and agriculture.</li>
            <li><strong>5G:</strong> The next-generation wireless standard with ultra-low latency and high data transfer speeds, supporting the expansion of IoT applications, especially in smart cities and autonomous vehicles.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>IoT Layers</h2>
        <p>
            The architecture of IoT can be broken down into different layers, each responsible for specific tasks in the system. The key layers of an IoT architecture are:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Perception Layer:</strong> This is the physical layer where sensors and actuators collect data from the environment. Devices at this layer include temperature sensors, humidity sensors, and motion detectors.</li>
            <li><strong>Network Layer:</strong> The network layer is responsible for transmitting the data collected by the perception layer to the processing layer. This layer uses protocols like Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, Zigbee, and cellular networks for communication.</li>
            <li><strong>Edge Layer:</strong> This layer processes data locally at the device level, reducing the amount of data sent to the cloud for further analysis. It helps in real-time decision making and reducing latency.</li>
            <li><strong>Processing Layer (Cloud Layer):</strong> This layer involves the processing, storage, and analysis of data in cloud platforms. It uses powerful computing resources to run algorithms and extract actionable insights from the data collected.</li>
            <li><strong>Application Layer:</strong> The final layer interacts with end-users and other systems. It includes the interface for users to view data, manage devices, and make decisions. Examples include mobile apps and web dashboards used in smart homes, healthcare, and industry automation.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Applications of IoT</h2>
        <p>
            IoT has a broad range of applications across various industries. Here are some of the key sectors leveraging IoT technology:
        </p>
